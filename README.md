# arcgispro-many-to-many-join
A custom ArcPy geoprocessing tool for ArcGIS Pro that performs a many-to-many join between two feature layers or tables, preserving all fields and geometry. The tool is implemented as a Python toolbox (.pyt) and uses pure ArcPy logicâ€”no pandas or external dependencies required.
